## Description

-   **Y** is the dependent variable in the regression. **Y** is the
    level of the outcome if one wants to estimate the weights attached
    to the fixed-effects regression, and **Y** is the first difference
    of the outcome if one wants to estimate the weights attached to the
    first-difference regression.
-   **G** is a variable identifying each group.
-   **T** is a variable identifying each period.
-   **D** is the treatment variable in the regression. **D** is the
    level of the treatment if one wants to estimate the weights attached
    to the fixed-effects regression, and **D** is the first difference
    of the treatment if one wants to estimate the weights attached to
    the first-difference regression.
-   If **type**(*fdTR*) is specified in the option type below, then the
    command requires a fifth argument, **D0**. **D0** is the mean of the
    treatment in group g and at period t. It should be non-missing at
    the first period when a group appears in the data (e.g. at t=1 for
    the groups that are in the data from the beginning), and for all
    observations for which the first-difference of the group-level mean
    outcome and treatment are non missing.

### Options

-   **type** is a required option that can take four values: *feTR*,
    *feS*, *fdTR*, *fdS*. If *feTR* is specified, the command estimates
    the weights and sensitivity measures attached to the fixed-effects
    regression under the common trends assumption. With *feS*, it
    estimates the weights and sensitivity measures attached to the
    fixed-effects regression under common trends and the assumption that
    groups’ treatment effect does not change over time. With *fdTR*, it
    estimates the weights and sensitivity measures attached to the
    first-difference regression under the common trends assumption.
    Finally, with *fdS* it estimates the weights and sensitivity
    measures attached to the first-difference regression under common
    trends and the assumption that groups’ treatment effect does not
    change over time.
-   **summary_measures** displays complementary results from the
    computation of the weights. Specifically, the option outputs: (*i*)
    the point estimate of the coefficient on the **D** variable from a
    TWFE regression, (*ii*) the minimum value of the standard deviation
    of the ATEs compatible with the coefficient from the TWFE regression
    and ATE across all treated (g,t) cells being equal to zero, (*iii*)
    the minimum value of the standard deviation of the ATEs compatible
    with the coefficient from the TWFE regression and ATE across all
    treated (g,t) cells having different signs (this is computed only if
    the sum of negative weights is different from 0). See the FAQ
    section for other details.
-   **test_random_weights** when this option is specified, the command
    estimates the correlation between each variable in *varlist* and the
    weights. Testing if those correlations significantly differ from
    zero is a way to assess whether the weights are as good as randomly
    assigned to groups and time periods. When **other_treatments** is
    specified, the command only reports the correlation between each
    variable and the weights attached to the main treatment, not the
    correlations between each variable and the contamination weights
    attached to the other treatments.
-   **controls** is a list of control variables that are included in the
    regression. Controls should not vary within each group x period
    cell, because the results in in de Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille
    (2020a) apply to two-way fixed effects regressions with group x
    period level controls. If a control does vary within a group x
    period cell, the command will replace it by its average value within
    each group x period cell.
-   **other_treatments** is a list of other treatment variables that are
    included in the regression. While the results in de Chaisemartin &
    D’Haultfoeuille (2020a) do not cover two-way fixed effects
    regressions with several treatments, those in de Chaisemartin &
    D’Haultfoeuille (2020b) do, so the command follows results from that
    second paper when **other_treatments** is specified. This option can
    only be used when **type(*feTR*)** is specified. When it is
    specified, the command reports the number and sum of positive and
    negative weights attached to the treatment, but it does not report
    the summary measures of the regression’s robustness to heterogeneous
    treatment effects, as these summary measures are no longer
    applicable when the regression has several treatment variables. The
    command also reports the weights attached to the other treatments.
    The weights reported by the command are those in Corollary 1 in de
    Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille (2020b). See de Chaisemartin &
    D’Haultfoeuille (2020b) for further details.
-   **weight**: if the regression is weighted, the weight variable can
    be specified in **weight**. If **type(*fdTR*)** is specified, then
    the weight variable should be non-missing at the first period when a
    group appears in the data (e.g. at t=1 for the groups that are in
    the data from the beginning), and for all observations for which the
    first-difference of the group-level mean outcome and treatment are
    non missing.
-   **path** allows the user to specify a path (e.g D:.dta) where a .dta
    file containing 3 variables (Group, Time, Weight) will be saved.
    This option allows the user to see the weight attached to each group
    x time cell. If the **other_treatments** option is specified, the
    weights attached to the other treatments are also saved in the .dta
    file.

## FAQ

#### *How can one interpret the summary measures of the regression’s robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects?*

When the two-way fixed effects regression has only one treatment
variable, the command reports two summary measures of the robustness of
the treatment coefficient beta to treatment heterogeneity across groups
and over time. The first one is defined in point (i) of Corollary 1 in
de Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille (2020a). It corresponds to the minimal
value of the standard deviation of the treatment effect across the
treated groups and time periods under which beta and the average
treatment effect on the treated (ATT) could be of opposite signs. When
that number is large, this means that beta and the ATT can only be of
opposite signs if there is a lot of treatment effect heterogeneity
across groups and time periods. When that number is low, this means that
beta and the ATT can be of opposite signs even if there is not a lot of
treatment effect heterogeneity across groups and time periods. The
second summary measure is defined in point (ii) of Corollary 1 in de
Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille (2020a). It corresponds to the minimal
value of the standard deviation of the treatment effect across the
treated groups and time periods under which beta could be of a different
sign than the treatment effect in all the treated group and time
periods.

#### *How can I tell if the first summary measure is high or low?*

Assume that the first summary measure is equal to x. How can you tell if
x is a low or a high amount of treatment effect heterogeneity? This is
not an easy question to answer, but here is one possibility. Let us
assume that the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a
uniform distribution. Then, to have that the mean of that distribution
is 0 while its standard deviation is x, the treatment effects should be
uniformly distributed on the \[-sqrt(3)x,sqrt(3)x\] interval. Then, you
can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that some (g,t) cells have
a treatment effect as large as sqrt(3)x, while other cells have a
treatment effect as low as -sqrt(3)x? If the answer is negative, that
is, you think that it is not reasonable to assume that the treatment
effect will exceed the +/-sqrt(3)x bounds for some (g,t) cells, this
means that the uniform distribution of treatment effects compatible with
an ATT of 0 and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you.
Then, you can consider that the command’s first summary measure is high,
and that it is unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign.
Conversely, if the answer is positive, that is, you believe that the
treatment effect might exceed the bounds for some (g,t) cells, it may
not be unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign.

The previous sensitivity exercise assumes that treatment effects follow
a uniform distribution. You may find it more reasonable to assume that
they are, say, normally distributed. Then you can conduct the following,
similar exercise. If the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from
a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation x normal
distribution, 95% of them will fall within the \[-1.96x,1.96x\]
interval, and 5% will fall outside of that interval. Then, you can ask
yourself: is it reasonable to assume that 2.5% of (g,t) cells have a
treatment effect larger than 1.96x, while 2.5% have a treatment effect
lower than -1.96? If the answer is negative, that is, you are willing to
assume that at most 2.5% of the treatment effects fall out of the
\[-1.96x,1.96x\] interval at each side, this means that the normal
distribution of treatment effects compatible with an ATT of 0 and a
standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can consider
that the command’s first summary measure is high, and that it is
unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign.

#### *How can I tell if the second summary measure is high or low?*

Assume that the second summary measure is equal to x. To fix ideas, let
us assume that beta\>0. Let us assume that the treatment effects of
(g,t) cells are drawn from a uniform distribution. Then, one could have
that those effects are all negative, with a standard deviation equal to
x, for instance if they are uniformly drawn from the \[-2sqrt(3)x,0\].
Then, you can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that some (g,t)
cells have a treatment effect as low as -2sqrt(3)x? If the answer is
negative, that is, you are not willing to assume that some (g,t) cells
have a treatment effect lower than -2sqrt(3)x, this means that the
uniform distribution of treatment effects compatible with sign reversal
and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can
consider that the command’s second summary measure is high, and that
sign reversal is unlikely. If the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are
all negative, they cannot follow a normal distribution, so we do not
discuss that possibility here.

## Examples

The following example is based on data from F. Vella and M. Verbeek
(1998), “Whose Wages Do Unions Raise? A Dynamic Model of Unionism and
Wage Rate Determination for Young Men”. Results and further details
about the estimation below can be found in Section V.C of de
Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille (2020a).

### Stata

Run the following line to load the dataset:

``` s
use "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaisemartinPackages/twowayfeweights/main/wagepan_twfeweights.dta", clear
```

The next line estimates the weights from a TWFE regression of log wage
(Y) on union status (D), individual worker (G) and year (T) fixed
effects:

``` s
twowayfeweights lwage nr year union, type(feTR) test_random_weights(educ) summary_measures
```

The next line performs the same exercise using first differences of
outcome and treatment:

``` s
twowayfeweights diff_lwage nr year diff_union union, type(fdTR) test_random_weights(educ) summary_measures
```

### R

Run the following line to download the dataset in your local working
directory and load it to your R environment:

``` r
library(TwoWayFEWeights)

## We need the haven package to read in the .dta file in this example
# install.packages("haven")

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaisemartinPackages/twowayfeweights/main/wagepan_twfeweights.dta"
wagepan =  haven::read_dta(url)
```

The next line estimates the weights from a TWFE regression of log wage
(Y) on union status (D), individual worker (G) and year (T) fixed
effects:

``` r
est = twowayfeweights(
  wagepan,                        # dataset
  "lwage", "nr", "year", "union", # Required Y, G, T, and D args
  type                = "feTR",   # start of optional args...
  summary_measures    = TRUE,
  test_random_weights = "educ"
)
```

The next line performs the same exercise using first differences of
outcome and treatment:

``` r
est2 = twowayfeweights(
  wagepan,
  "diff_lwage", "nr", "year", "diff_union", # use differenced versions of Y and D
  type                = "fdTR",             # changed
  D0                  = "union",            # added (req'd arg for fdTR type)
  summary_measures    = TRUE,
  test_random_weights = "educ"
)
```

#### Warning

Please note that the number of negative weights could be different from
Section V.C. of de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille (2020a) due to
rounding errors that affected older versions of the commands.
